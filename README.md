> Ayyyyyyyyyyyy, this is my Passion Project ReadMe. As of 8/16/2016 (when I restarted), the goal of this project is to create an interactive website for **anyone** to view **U.S. Bill** information, from any state.

> The sole purpose of having Users with accounts is to have open discussion on the Bill's information, the people & motives behind it, & alternatives to it. Currently, the idea is that this will be done through the comments underneath the bill (collapsing coment chains is most likely the way I will try to pursue this), with the idea of seperate forms being adding & the comments under the bill just being the 'highlights' of the comments.

> There will be a voteing system in place, but the votes only go in one direction. Users will be able to remove their votes within a certain time frame (Probably based on the Users activity around the Bill, like if they continue to view the Bill weekly, they will be able to take away their vote at any time).
